a. Jack Reeves think programming is fundamentally a design activity and the only final representation of the design is the source co
de itself. Programming is not about building sofrware; programming is about designing software.

b. Because sofrware is too complex and it depends on too many other things. Despite we try every attempts to prevent problems in des
igning code or writng sofrware, important details will be overlooked. There was no way to discover  them earlier. When they are disc
overed, they force a change in the design. This is the difference between craft and engineering.

c. Because what we need is a unified design notation suitable for all levels of design. We need a programming language that is also
suitable for capturing high level design concepts. So the language is not need to be object-oriented.

d. Because the software is cheap to build and relatively easy to turn out but it tends to be incredibly large and complex. Additiona
lly, software designs are almost always constantly evolving. Software designers do not have or use more formal methods of validating
 their designs because of the simple economics of the software build cycle. also, there are some difference between software and mod
ern indusry(non-sofrware engineering), such as , in sofrware even the smallest piece of code is likely to be revised or completely r
ewritten during testing and debugging, which will never happen in modern industry.
